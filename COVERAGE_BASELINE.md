# Coverage Baseline

**Note:** The initial baseline test run (`npm test -- --coverage`) failed due to setup errors (conflicting Jest/Vitest configurations and runtime errors). As a result, a coverage report could not be generated.

This file should be populated after the initial test setup and major failures are resolved.
