## Development Environment

- Node.js: v20 (or as specified in `.nvmrc`/`package.json`)
- Supabase Project (for waitlist database)
- Resend Account (for email sending)

## Getting Started

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your Supabase, Stripe, and Resend keys:

    ```
    # See .env.example for all required variables
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
    RESEND_API_KEY=...
    STRIPE_CLIENT_ID=...
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=... # Required for webhook endpoints
    # Additional variables needed for specific features
    ```

    > **Note:** Environment files are not in repo; create them locally using values printed by setup scripts.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4.  **For Stripe Guardian Development:**
    If you're working with Stripe Guardian features, see [Guardian Local Development](./docs/guardian/local-dev.md) for detailed instructions on setting up Stripe Connect OAuth and webhooks locally.

## Database Setup

If you're working with the Stripe Guardian component, you'll need to set up the database schema:

1. **Start Supabase Local Development:**

   ```bash
   npm run supabase:start
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

This will create all required tables and seed initial test data, including the new `settings` table and `alerts_notify_tg` trigger for notifications.

### Data Model

Guardian uses the following core tables:

- `connected_accounts`: Stripe Connect accounts linked to the platform. Includes `rule_set_id` to link to custom rule thresholds.
- `rule_sets`: Stores named rule configurations (JSON) including the `default` set.
- `event_buffer`: Raw Stripe webhook events awaiting processing
- `processed_events`: Idempotency tracking table to ensure each event is processed exactly once
- `alerts`: Fraud alerts generated by rule evaluations
- `settings`: Global (or potentially per-account) settings for notifications (tier, email, Slack).
- `alert_channels`: Notification and auto-pause settings per account

> **Note:** Environment files (.env.local) are git-ignored; copy values printed by setup scripts such as `scripts/apply_event_buffer_migration.py` which will suggest environment variables like `EVENT_BUFFER_TTL_DAYS`.

## Guardian Configuration

### Rule Thresholds

Fraud detection rule thresholds (e.g., velocity limits, minimum payout amounts) can be customized per Stripe account.

1.  Create a new rule set configuration (or use the `default`) in the `public.rule_sets` table. You can use the helper script:
    ```bash
    # Requires a JSON file with the config structure
    npx ts-node scripts/create_rule_set.ts -n <rule_set_name> -f <path_to_config.json>
    # Note the returned Rule Set ID (UUID)
    ```
2.  Update the target account in `public.connected_accounts`, setting its `rule_set_id` to the UUID of the desired rule set.

See `docs/guardian/rules.md` for more details.

### Alert Notifications

Guardian can send email and Slack notifications when new alerts are generated.

See [docs/guardian/notifications.md](./docs/guardian/notifications.md) for setup instructions, required environment variables, and configuration details.

### Risk Score

Guardian calculates a numerical risk score (0-100) for each alert, blending rule weights with historical false positive feedback. This score is displayed in the UI and included in notifications. See [docs/guardian/risk-score.md](./docs/guardian/risk-score.md) for how the score is computed.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js ESLint config.
- `npm run format`: Formats code using Prettier.
- `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build.
- `npm start`: Starts the production server (requires `npm run build` first).

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests use Jest and can be run with `npm test`.

### End-to-End Tests

We use Playwright for lightweight smoke tests that verify our key marketing pages load correctly:

```bash
# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run in debug mode with browser UI
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e
```

See `/tests/e2e/README.md` for more details on e2e tests.

### Full Stack E2E Test (GitHub Actions)

A comprehensive end-to-end test harness runs in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/supabase-e2e.yml`) on pushes/PRs to `main`:

1.  **Setup**: Checks out code, installs dependencies.
2.  **Supabase**: Starts a local Supabase instance using the official CLI action and applies all migrations.
3.  **Seed**: Seeds a dedicated test user and connected account (`ci-tester@dock108.ai`, `acct_ci123`).
4.  **App Start**: Starts the Next.js application locally.
5.  **Stripe Replay**: Uses the Stripe CLI to replay a fixture file (`test/fixtures/full_day.jsonl`) containing ~50 realistic events against the local application's webhook endpoint.
6.  **Processing Wait**: Waits for the backend (Reactor, etc.) to process the events (currently uses a fixed delay, ideally would check metrics).
7.  **Playwright Test**: Runs the relevant Playwright test spec (e.g., `e2e/alerts-dashboard.spec.ts`):
    - Verifies the real-time alert badge appears in the header.
    - Navigates to the alerts dashboard by clicking the badge.
    - Checks that expected alert types (from the fixture) are present in the alerts table.
    - Confirms the alert badge clears after navigation (marking as read).
    - Can interact with the database via API calls if needed for verification.
8.  **Artifacts**: Uploads Playwright reports (`playwright-report/`) and Stripe CLI logs for debugging.

This workflow acts as a critical regression gate before deployments.

**Running Locally:**

While the full flow relies on GitHub Actions secrets and setup, you can simulate parts locally:

1.  Ensure Supabase local dev is running (`supabase start`).
2.  Ensure migrations are applied (`supabase db reset`).
3.  Manually run the seed SQL for the CI user (see G-18 issue or workflow file).
4.  Ensure your `.env.local` has Supabase/Stripe keys and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_fixture_secret` (matching the workflow).
5.  Start the app: `npm run dev`.
6.  In another terminal, run the fixture replay: `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook --events-from-file test/fixtures/full_day.jsonl`.
7.  Run the specific Playwright spec: `npx playwright test e2e/alerts-dashboard.spec.ts` (ensure relevant env vars like `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` are set or configured in `playwright.config.ts`).

## Deployment

This project is intended for deployment on Vercel. Ensure environment variables for Supabase and Resend are set in the Vercel project settings.

### Deployment Workflow

Guardian uses an automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliable deployments:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Push to main] --> B[Create Supabase Branch]
    B --> C[Deploy to Vercel Preview]
    C --> D[Run E2E Tests]
    D -- Success --> E[Await Manual Approval]
    D -- Failure --> F[Delete Supabase Branch]
    E -- Approved --> G[Promote to Production]
    G --> H[Deploy Supabase Branch to Prod]
    H --> I[Delete Staging Branch]
    I --> J[Notify Slack if Configured]
```

The deployment process is fully automated through GitHub Actions:

1. **Staging**: Every push to `main` creates a clean staging environment with dedicated Supabase branch and Vercel preview deployment.
2. **Testing**: E2E tests run against the staging environment to verify functionality.
3. **Approval**: A manual approval step allows verification before promoting to production.
4. **Production**: Upon approval, the staging environment is promoted to production.

For detailed information about the CI/CD pipeline, see [docs/guardian/ci-cd.md](./docs/guardian/ci-cd.md).

## ðŸš€ Deploying to Vercel

1. Duplicate `.env.example` â†’ `.env` and fill in the required secrets.
2. Push the secrets to Vercel:

```bash
npm run vercel:env
```

3. Deploy the app:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

The script will fail fast if any required secret is missing locally.

Supabase Edge Functions (`send-welcome-email`, `weekly-digest`) need to be deployed separately using the Supabase CLI and database triggers/cron schedules configured in the Supabase dashboard.

## Interactive Demos

### Guardian Demo

The Stripe Guardian demo (/guardian-demo) showcases fraud detection in action:

- **Scenario Selection**: Choose from predefined fraud scenarios (velocity breach, bank swap, geo-mismatch) using the dropdown.
- **Persistence**: Your selected scenario is remembered across page reloads via localStorage.
- **Playback Controls**: Restart, loop, and adjust playback speed of scenarios.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch events appear in the timeline and see fraud patterns emerge.

To add custom scenarios:

1. Add new JSON files in `public/guardian-demo/scenarios/` following the format in the existing files
2. Update the list of scenarios in `app/guardian-demo/getScenarios.ts`

## Running Lighthouse locally

After building the production bundle, you can run Lighthouse CI against key routes:

```bash
npm run build && npm lh-ci
# Reports are saved in .lighthouseci/index.html
```

## Accessibility

All body text meets WCAG AA contrast (â‰¥4.5:1) against white using slateâ€‘700. Primary navigation uses `data-current` attribute to render a bold, underlined state for the active page without extra JavaScript.

## Alpha Access

During the closed alpha phase, access to the application is restricted to a pre-approved list of email addresses.

To add new testers:

1. Add their email to the `ALPHA_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable in your Vercel settings
2. Multiple emails should be comma-separated:
   ```
   ALPHA_ALLOW_LIST=alice@example.com,bob@company.co,charlie@startup.io
   ```
3. Deploy the changes
4. Share the login URL with your testers

Users not on the allow list will be unable to sign up and will be prompted to contact `beta@dock108.ai` for access.

## Deploy checklist

When applying database migrations:

1. **Apply migrations locally first**

   ```bash
   supabase db push            # run once on your machine
   git add supabase/migrations
   git commit -m "chore(db): new migration"
   git push origin main       # Vercel build will skip db push
   ```

2. **Verify deployment**
   - Confirm Vercel build log no longer mentions "Connecting to remote databaseâ€¦"
   - Verify application functionality to ensure tables and triggers are working

Note: Vercel builds no longer run `supabase db push`. All migrations must be applied locally or through Supabase Studio before pushing code.

## Local development

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys (Supabase, Stripe, Resend):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Running tests

```bash
# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run in debug mode with browser UI
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e
```

See `/tests/e2e/README.md` for more details on e2e tests.

## User Settings (/settings)

Authenticated users can manage their account settings at the [/settings](/settings) page.

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot of the user settings page showing profile, password, theme, and API key sections." src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=User+Settings+Page+Screenshot+Placeholder">

### Features:

- **Profile**: Update display name and avatar URL.
- **Password**: Change account password (requires meeting complexity rules).
- **Theme**: Choose between Light, Dark, or System default themes.
- **API Keys**: Generate and revoke API keys for programmatic access.
  - **Note**: Generated API keys are shown only **once** upon creation. Store them securely.

### Development Notes:

- **Route**: `app/(auth)/settings/page.tsx` (Server Component)
- **UI Components**: Client components (`ProfileForm`, `PasswordForm`, etc.) located in the same directory.
- **Data**: Fetched server-side via `getProfile` from `lib/supabase/user.ts`.
- **Mutations**: Handled by Server Actions defined in `app/(auth)/settings/actions.ts`, calling helpers in `lib/supabase/user.ts`.
- **Database**: Uses the `public.profiles` table (linked to `auth.users`). RLS policies restrict access to the owner.

## For Stripe Guardian Development

### Setting Up Stripe Webhooks

Guardian processes Stripe events through a centralized webhook system:

1. **Run the webhook setup script:**

   ```bash
   npm run stripe:setup-webhook
   ```

   This script will:

   - Find or create a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account
   - Configure it to listen only to events needed by Guardian
   - Print the necessary environment variables to add to your `.env.local`

2. **Configure Environment:**

   - Add the webhook secret printed by the script to your `.env.local`:

   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   npm run stripe:verify-webhook
   ```
4. **Local Testing:**

   ```bash
   # Start your development server
   npm run dev

   # In a separate terminal, forward events to your local webhook
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

   # In a third terminal, trigger test events
   stripe trigger charge.failed
   stripe trigger payout.paid
   ```

5. **Event Flow:**
   - Events flow into the `event_buffer` table with the full payload preserved
   - Guardian only accepts events defined in `lib/guardian/stripeEvents.ts`
   - The guardian-reactor processes events asynchronously
   - Failed processing attempts are tracked in `failed_event_dispatch` for retries
   - **Historical Backfill**: Upon initial connection via OAuth callback (`/api/stripe/oauth/callback`), a background job (`guardian-backfill`) is triggered to fetch the last 90 days of relevant events for the account and process them via the `event_buffer` and `guardian-reactor`. See `docs/guardian/backfill.md` for details.

### Validation

Guardian implements strict schema validation for all Stripe events:

1. **Strict Mode (Default):**

   - All incoming webhook payloads are validated against Zod schemas
   - Invalid payloads are rejected with a 400 response and clear error message
   - Ensures the reactor never processes malformed data that could cause errors

2. **Development Mode:**

   - During local development, you can disable strict validation:

   ```
   STRICT_STRIPE_VALIDATION=false
   ```

   - This is useful when working with newer Stripe API versions or testing custom event shapes
   - The environment variable hint is printed to console on startup

3. **Error Handling:**
   - `unsupported_event_type`: Event type not in GUARDIAN_EVENTS list
   - `unsupported_event_shape`: Event payload doesn't match expected schema
   - All validation errors are logged for debugging

For more details on Guardian local development, see [Guardian Local Development](./docs/guardian/local-dev.md).

## Operations

Operational tasks and monitoring for the DOCK108 platform:

- **Guardian Data Retention**: A nightly job (`guardian-retention-job`) automatically scrubs sensitive data from `event_buffer` payloads after 30 days (configurable via `EVENT_BUFFER_TTL_DAYS`) and purges the records entirely after 37 days. See `docs/guardian/retention.md` for details.

## Observability

Guardian provides structured logging and Prometheus metrics for monitoring and debugging.

- **Structured Logging**: All components emit JSON logs with consistent fields (`req_id`, `service`, etc.). See `docs/guardian/logging.md` for format details and configuration (`LOG_LEVEL`).
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Key operational metrics are exposed:
  - Next.js Webhook: Scrape `/api/metrics`. (TODO: Implement dedicated metrics endpoint)
  - Supabase Edge Functions: Use log-based metrics derived from structured logs.
  - Requires `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` for the Supabase `/guardian-metrics` endpoint (placeholder).
  - See `docs/guardian/metrics.md` for metric details and scraping instructions.
  - A starter Grafana dashboard is available at `docs/guardian/grafana.json`.
- **Real-time Alert Badge**: The dashboard header includes a notification icon that displays a badge with the count of unread alerts, updated in real-time via Supabase subscriptions. Clicking the icon navigates to the alerts page and marks alerts as read.

## Type Safety

Guardian development enforces strict TypeScript settings to catch errors early and improve code reliability.

- **Strict Compilation**: The `tsconfig.json` is configured with `"strict": true` and related flags. The CI pipeline includes a `pnpm tsc --noEmit` step that fails the build if any TypeScript errors are present.
- **Supabase Type Generation**: Database types are generated directly from your Supabase schema.
  - **To Regenerate**: After making schema changes (e.g., applying new migrations), run:
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual Supabase project ID
    pnpm gen:types
    # Or: npm run gen:types
    ```
  - This command executes `supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --schema public > types/supabase.ts`.
  - Commit the updated `types/supabase.ts` file.
- **Code Standards**: Avoid using `any` where possible. Use type guards, non-nullable assertions (`!`) sparingly, and leverage the generated Supabase types (`Tables<'table_name'>`, `TablesInsert<'table_name'>`, etc.) for database interactions.

## Admin UI

The Admin UI allows users with the `admin` role to manage rule sets and notification settings for the application. Access is restricted via Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase.

### Features

- **Dashboard**: View metrics and quick links to various admin sections
- **Notification Channels**: Create and manage notification channels for alerts
- **Rule Sets**: Manage rule sets that define which alerts are triggered for accounts
- **Connected Accounts**: View and manage connected Stripe accounts and assign rule sets

### Access Control

The admin area is protected by role-based access control. Only users with the `admin` role in their JWT claims can access the admin pages. This is enforced in the `app/admin/layout.tsx` component.

To grant admin access to a user, set the `app_metadata` in Supabase:

```sql
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_app_meta_data = jsonb_set(raw_app_meta_data, '{role}', '"admin"')
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

### Row Level Security

The admin UI enforces permissions through Row Level Security policies in Supabase. The SQL for these policies is located in `supabase/migrations/20250426_admin_rls.sql`. Make sure to execute this SQL after deploying the application.

## Local Development

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys (Supabase, Stripe, Resend):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Running tests

```bash
# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run in debug mode with browser UI
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e
```

See `/tests/e2e/README.md` for more details on e2e tests.

## User Settings (/settings)

Authenticated users can manage their account settings at the [/settings](/settings) page.

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot of the user settings page showing profile, password, theme, and API key sections." src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=User+Settings+Page+Screenshot+Placeholder">

# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run in debug mode with browser UI
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e
```

See `/tests/e2e/README.md` for more details on e2e tests.

## User Settings (/settings)

Authenticated users can manage their account settings at the [/settings](/settings) page.

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot of the user settings page showing profile, password, theme, and API key sections." src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=User+Settings+Page+Screenshot+Placeholder">

### Features:

- **Profile**: Update display name and avatar URL.
- **Password**: Change account password (requires meeting complexity rules).
- **Theme**: Choose between Light, Dark, or System default themes.
- **API Keys**: Generate and revoke API keys for programmatic access.
  - **Note**: Generated API keys are shown only **once** upon creation. Store them securely.

### Development Notes:

- **Route**: `app/(auth)/settings/page.tsx` (Server Component)
- **UI Components**: Client components (`ProfileForm`, `PasswordForm`, etc.) located in the same directory.
- **Data**: Fetched server-side via `getProfile` from `lib/supabase/user.ts`.
- **Mutations**: Handled by Server Actions defined in `app/(auth)/settings/actions.ts`, calling helpers in `lib/supabase/user.ts`.
- **Database**: Uses the `public.profiles` table (linked to `auth.users`). RLS policies restrict access to the owner.

## For Stripe Guardian Development

### Setting Up Stripe Webhooks

Guardian processes Stripe events through a centralized webhook system:

1. **Run the webhook setup script:**

   ```bash
   npm run stripe:setup-webhook
   ```

   This script will:

   - Find or create a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account
   - Configure it to listen only to events needed by Guardian
   - Print the necessary environment variables to add to your `.env.local`

2. **Configure Environment:**

   - Add the webhook secret printed by the script to your `.env.local`:

   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   npm run stripe:verify-webhook
   ```
4. **Local Testing:**

   ```bash
   # Start your development server
   npm run dev

   # In a separate terminal, forward events to your local webhook
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

   # In a third terminal, trigger test events
   stripe trigger charge.failed
   stripe trigger payout.paid
   ```

5. **Event Flow:**
   - Events flow into the `event_buffer` table with the full payload preserved
   - Guardian only accepts events defined in `lib/guardian/stripeEvents.ts`
   - The guardian-reactor processes events asynchronously
   - Failed processing attempts are tracked in `failed_event_dispatch` for retries
   - **Historical Backfill**: Upon initial connection via OAuth callback (`/api/stripe/oauth/callback`), a background job (`guardian-backfill`) is triggered to fetch the last 90 days of relevant events for the account and process them via the `event_buffer` and `guardian-reactor`. See `docs/guardian/backfill.md` for details.

### Validation

Guardian implements strict schema validation for all Stripe events:

1. **Strict Mode (Default):**

   - All incoming webhook payloads are validated against Zod schemas
   - Invalid payloads are rejected with a 400 response and clear error message
   - Ensures the reactor never processes malformed data that could cause errors

2. **Development Mode:**

   - During local development, you can disable strict validation:

   ```
   STRICT_STRIPE_VALIDATION=false
   ```

   - This is useful when working with newer Stripe API versions or testing custom event shapes
   - The environment variable hint is printed to console on startup

3. **Error Handling:**
   - `unsupported_event_type`: Event type not in GUARDIAN_EVENTS list
   - `unsupported_event_shape`: Event payload doesn't match expected schema
   - All validation errors are logged for debugging

For more details on Guardian local development, see [Guardian Local Development](./docs/guardian/local-dev.md).

## Operations

Operational tasks and monitoring for the DOCK108 platform:

- **Guardian Data Retention**: A nightly job (`guardian-retention-job`) automatically scrubs sensitive data from `event_buffer` payloads after 30 days (configurable via `EVENT_BUFFER_TTL_DAYS`) and purges the records entirely after 37 days. See `docs/guardian/retention.md` for details.

## Observability

Guardian provides structured logging and Prometheus metrics for monitoring and debugging.

- **Structured Logging**: All components emit JSON logs with consistent fields (`req_id`, `service`, etc.). See `docs/guardian/logging.md` for format details and configuration (`LOG_LEVEL`).
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Key operational metrics are exposed:
  - Next.js Webhook: Scrape `/api/metrics`. (TODO: Implement dedicated metrics endpoint)
  - Supabase Edge Functions: Use log-based metrics derived from structured logs.
  - Requires `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` for the Supabase `/guardian-metrics` endpoint (placeholder).
  - See `docs/guardian/metrics.md` for metric details and scraping instructions.
  - A starter Grafana dashboard is available at `docs/guardian/grafana.json`.
- **Real-time Alert Badge**: The dashboard header includes a notification icon that displays a badge with the count of unread alerts, updated in real-time via Supabase subscriptions. Clicking the icon navigates to the alerts page and marks alerts as read.

## Type Safety

Guardian development enforces strict TypeScript settings to catch errors early and improve code reliability.

- **Strict Compilation**: The `tsconfig.json` is configured with `"strict": true` and related flags. The CI pipeline includes a `pnpm tsc --noEmit` step that fails the build if any TypeScript errors are present.
- **Supabase Type Generation**: Database types are generated directly from your Supabase schema.
  - **To Regenerate**: After making schema changes (e.g., applying new migrations), run:
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual Supabase project ID
    pnpm gen:types
    # Or: npm run gen:types
    ```
  - This command executes `supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --schema public > types/supabase.ts`.
  - Commit the updated `types/supabase.ts` file.
- **Code Standards**: Avoid using `any` where possible. Use type guards, non-nullable assertions (`!`) sparingly, and leverage the generated Supabase types (`Tables<'table_name'>`, `TablesInsert<'table_name'>`, etc.) for database interactions.

## Admin UI

The Admin UI allows users with the `admin` role to manage rule sets and notification settings for the application. Access is restricted via Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase.

### Features

- **Dashboard**: View metrics and quick links to various admin sections
- **Notification Channels**: Create and manage notification channels for alerts
- **Rule Sets**: Manage rule sets that define which alerts are triggered for accounts
- **Connected Accounts**: View and manage connected Stripe accounts and assign rule sets

### Access Control

The admin area is protected by role-based access control. Only users with the `admin` role in their JWT claims can access the admin pages. This is enforced in the `app/admin/layout.tsx` component.

To grant admin access to a user, set the `app_metadata` in Supabase:

```sql
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_app_meta_data = jsonb_set(raw_app_meta_data, '{role}', '"admin"')
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

### Row Level Security

The admin UI enforces permissions through Row Level Security policies in Supabase. The SQL for these policies is located in `supabase/migrations/20250426_admin_rls.sql`. Make sure to execute this SQL after deploying the application.

## Local Development

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys (Supabase, Stripe, Resend):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Running tests

```bash
# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run in debug mode with browser UI
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e
```

See `/tests/e2e/README.md` for more details on e2e tests.
