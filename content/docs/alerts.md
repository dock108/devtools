# How Alerts Work

Stripe Guardian analyzes events from connected Stripe accounts and creates actionable alerts when it detects suspicious behaviors. This guide explains how alerts work, what they contain, and how to respond to them.

## Alert Lifecycle

Alerts follow a defined lifecycle in Guardian:

1. **Detection**: Guardian monitors incoming Stripe events for suspicious patterns
2. **Evaluation**: Events matching rule criteria trigger an alert
3. **Notification**: Alerts are delivered via configured channels (email, Slack)
4. **Triage**: Your team reviews the alert details and determines next steps
5. **Resolution**: The alert is marked as resolved (true positive or false positive)
6. **Learning**: Feedback improves future risk scoring accuracy

## Alert Types

Guardian detects several types of suspicious behaviors:

| Alert Type            | Description                                      | Risk Indicators                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payout Velocity**   | Unusually high number of payouts in a short time | Multiple payouts close together, higher than normal volume |
| **Bank Account Swap** | Bank account change followed by large payout     | Recent external account change, large payout amount        |
| **Geo Mismatch**      | Geographic mismatch between IP and bank country  | IP location different from bank country code               |
| **Charge Failures**   | High rate of failed charge attempts              | Multiple failed charges in short succession                |
| **Capability Change** | Suspicious capability enablement or disablement  | Sudden loss of capabilities before payout                  |
| **High-Risk Reviews** | Stripe-flagged review with high risk level       | Review with elevated risk score from Stripe                |

## Alert Metadata

Guardian stores minimal metadata about each alert to help you make informed decisions. Each alert includes:

- Alert type and risk score
- Timestamp and affected account ID
- Key data points relevant to the alert type
- Link to the Stripe Dashboard for the affected account

## Alert Dashboard

The alerts dashboard provides an overview of all detected issues:

<Alert type="info">
  The dashboard shows all alerts across your connected accounts, with filtering options for account,
  alert type, and time range.
</Alert>

### Alert Details Page

Clicking on an alert takes you to a detailed view with:

- Full context about the alert (what happened and why it's suspicious)
- Timeline of relevant events leading up to the alert
- Quick actions to resolve the alert or leave feedback
- Notification status (which teams have been notified)

## Responding to Alerts

When you receive an alert, you should:

1. Review the alert details to understand the potential issue
2. Check the Stripe Dashboard for additional context
3. Take appropriate action based on your platform's policies
4. Mark the alert as resolved with appropriate feedback

### Feedback Options

Guardian learns from your feedback to improve future risk scoring:

- **True Positive** - Real fraud was detected
- **False Positive** - Legitimate activity was flagged incorrectly
- **Not Sure** - Unable to determine

<Alert type="warning">
  Providing accurate feedback helps Guardian improve the accuracy of future alerts by adjusting risk
  scoring models.
</Alert>

## Alert Retention

Alerts are retained for audit and compliance purposes. Retention periods can be configured based on your organization's needs and compliance requirements.
