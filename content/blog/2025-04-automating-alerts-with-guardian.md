Stripe Guardian doesn't just generate alerts; it helps you **act** on them faster.

Connect Guardian to your existing tools—Slack, email, or even custom webhooks—to route high-risk alerts directly to the right people.

## Why Automate?

Manual alert checks are slow and error-prone. Automation ensures:

- **Speed:** Critical alerts reach reviewers in seconds.
- **Consistency:** Standardised info in every notification.
- **Focus:** Teams review _actual_ risks, not noise.

## How it Works

1. **Configure Channels:** In Guardian settings, add Slack channel IDs or email addresses.
2. **Set Thresholds:** Define which alert `risk_score` triggers a notification.
3. **Guardian Delivers:** When a qualifying alert fires, Guardian pushes the details (account ID, rule violated, risk score, event timestamp) to your chosen channel.

## Example: Slack Integration

```json
// Sample Slack alert payload
{
  "alert_id": "ga_123abc",
  "account_id": "acct_XYZ789",
  "rule_triggered": "payout_velocity",
  "risk_score": 85,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T10:30:00Z",
  "link_to_alert": "https://guardian.dock108.ai/alerts/ga_123abc"
}
```

This payload allows your team to quickly triage from within Slack.

## Getting Started

Visit the **Settings > Notifications** page in your Guardian dashboard to connect your first channel.
