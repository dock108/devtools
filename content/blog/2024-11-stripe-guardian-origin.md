### The Moment We Noticed the Gap

Stripe Radar protects against **charge fraud**, but it doesn't keep an eye on **payout behaviour**.  
While auditing our own marketplace data, we saw patterns—**multiple rapid payouts, country-mismatch bank accounts**—that weren't blocked by default.

### Prototype Lessons (Short Version)

We first logged webhooks to a spreadsheet. It worked for a day, then throttled and delayed alerts.  
That experiment taught us three design rules:

1. **Real-time ingestion** (no polling).
2. **Rule engine + risk score** instead of hard-coded thresholds.
3. **Data minimisation**—delete raw events after 30 days.

### Where Guardian Stands Today

| Capability                        | Status |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Stripe Connect OAuth              | ✅     |
| 90-day historical back-fill       | ✅     |
| Velocity / geo / capability rules | ✅     |
| Email & Slack alerts              | ✅     |
| 30-day data retention purges      | ✅     |

### What's Next
