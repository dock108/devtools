### Where We Stand

| Metric                       | Value                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Total alerts fired           | 4,782                     |
| Avg. webhook â†’ alert latency | 1.3s                      |
| Fraud dollars blocked        | "Unprintable"â€”but > $0 ðŸ‘€ |

### Beta Limits

- **2** connected Stripe accounts
- **Email & Slack** channels
- **30-day** data retention
- Free for the entire beta

### Q2 Roadmap

1. **Auto-Pause Payouts**  
   _High-risk (Score > 90) alerts can auto-pause the connected account so money never leaves._

2. **Custom Rule Builder**  
   _Drag-drop UI to combine filters (`event.type = payout._`AND`amount > $5,000` AND â€¦).\*

3. **Webhook Alert Channel**  
   _For folks who'd rather ingest alerts into Datadog than their inbox._
