Based on months of incoming webhook data across several production platforms, three payout-fraud patterns stand out.

## Trend 1 – Same-Day Payout Bursts

Newly onboarded accounts request payouts within hours, not days.  
**Why it matters:** Shorter observation windows give fraud teams less time to act.

_Guardian Mitigation_ → `payout_velocity` rule (thresholds are configurable based on typical business activity).

## Trend 2 – Geo / Bank-Country Mismatch

IP geolocation differs from the country of the connected bank account.

_Guardian Mitigation_ → `geo_mismatch` rule compares IP country vs `external_account_country`.

## Trend 3 – Capability Flip Abuse

Fraudsters toggle payout capabilities off, wait, then back on just before initiating large payouts.

_Guardian Mitigation_ → `capabilities_disabled` rule listens for `account.updated` events where payout capability status changes.

### Reference Table
