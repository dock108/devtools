## The Problem: Silent Payout Fraud

Stripe Connect is powerful, but its default fraud tools (Radar) are primarily designed for card payments, not platform payouts.

This leaves a gap where bad actors can exploit Express accounts...

// Example code block
function checkPayout(payout) {
  if (payout.amount > DAILY_LIMIT) {
    console.log('Limit exceeded!');
  }
}
```
